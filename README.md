### Description
-	A basic 3D engine experiment using only SDL2, gorilla-style.

(I know SDL2 is outdated)

### Dependencies, for now
-	libsdl2-dev
-	libsdl2-ttf-dev
-	pkg-config

### Build & Run
-	`make` to build
-	`./bin/3dsdl` to run

(Windows builds: also pretty straightforward if you have mingw64 and pkg-config pointing to the other libs)

### Controls
-   WASD: movement
-   Left-shift (hold): sprint
-   Space: jump
-   Mouse-wheel scrolling: adjust FOV

### License
WTFPL.
